Projects Focused on Inverted Index Concepts
1. https://github.com/dwayhs/go-search-engine
 Though it uses in-memory maps, it clearly shows how to structure indexing, querying, ranking — a great reference to layer mmap + binary into.

2. https://github.com/el10savio/Inverted-Index-Generator
Focuses on core inverted-index building logic — tokenization, storing word→doc mapping — which you can adapt to a mmap-backed system with fixed struct entries.
